My name's Lu√≠s Nabais and I'm a web software developer by profession, software engineer by training and currently reside in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. I was born in Lisbon, Portugal in the second half of the 1980s.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [ISCTE-IUL] in Lisbon and have been developing software professionally since 2012.

I write a blog in my native language of Portuguese that touches on topics ranging from anime to video-games called [NonsenseBB].
